```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
options(digits=2)
require(tidyverse)
require(tigerstats)
require(lubridate)
require(knitr)
data <- read.csv(file="https://onlinestatbook.com/case_studies_rvls/physical_strength/data.txt", sep="", header=TRUE)

### Model 1: SIMS~ARM
```{r}
basiccNN <- ggplot(data,aes(y=SIMS,x=ARM))
```

```{r}
basiccNN + geom_point() + ggtitle("SIMS vs ARM")
```
As we can see in the scatter plot for SIMS vs ARM above, we can see that the data is going uphill to the right. This relationship is a positive relationship.
